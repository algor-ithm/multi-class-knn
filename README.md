# Multi-Class Classification Using kNN  Model

A k-nearest neighbors (kNN) mdeol implemented to classify diffferent species of Iris flowers based on their features.

## Overview

This project This project demonstrates the implementation of a k-nearest neighbors (kNN) model to classify Iris flowers into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The dataset used is the famous Iris dataset. The kNN algorithm is implemented from scratch and also using the `sklearn` library for comparison. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
